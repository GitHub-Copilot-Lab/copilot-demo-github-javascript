# Getting started - Javascript Calculator - Visual Studio Code

Welcome to GitHub Copilot! What will be the best way to see the power of Copilot? Let's start with a simple application that everyone is familiar with, a Calculator created in Javascript. We will only
focus on the 4 main operations for a calculator: ```+, -, /, x```. By leveraging GitHub Copilot Chat, we will have a conversation with Copilot and have it handle all of the logic for us.

Although you can use any supported editor for Copilot like Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio IDE, NeoVim, and IntelliJ, we will use Visual Studio Code for this demo.
